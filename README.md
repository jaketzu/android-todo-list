# Native mobile development week 1 task: Todo list
This todo list app is a simple app for Android to keep track of tasks. 

## Installation
To install the app on your Android phone, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/jaketzu/android-todo-list/releases) tab and install and run the latest .apk file.

You can also clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio, where you can build the app and launch it.

### Usage
The app starts at the home screen, which is the only screen in the app. On this screen you can see options to add a task, buttons for sorting and filtering the tasks, and finally a view of all the tasks with a button to toggle whether the task is done next to each task.

To add a task, write the tasks title and description into the input boxes, select a priority level from the dropdown menu, and finally press the "Add task" button to add the task. The new task will be updated into the view of the tasks.

By pressing the "Filter by done" button, you can toggle between three different views of the tasks.
- 1. All tasks
- 2. Tasks which are not done
- 3. Tasks which are done

By pressing the "Sort by due date" button, you can toggle between viewing the tasks from the earliest due date first, and the latest due date first.

When you press the button next to a task, you toggle between the task being done and the task not being done.
